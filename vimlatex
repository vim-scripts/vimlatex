# vimlatex: Script wrapper for TeX/LaTeX/etc. that sanitizes output to
#           be compatible with Vim-LaTeX's errorformat. Prevents Vim
#           from opening the wrong file after some errors.
#
#           This script is inspired by
#
# http://hermitte.free.fr/vim/ressources/vimfiles/compiler/vim-tex_sh.html
#
# and
#
# http://www.unix.com/shell-programming-scripting/20218-pipelining.html
#
# Version: 1.06 (copyright text given below)
#
# Original author: Ted Pavlic
#                  ted@tedpavlic.com
#                  http://www.tedpavlic.com/
#
# Mercurial source code repository for original author's version:
#                  http://hg.tedpavlic.com/vimlatex/
#
# Usage: vimlatex %command [%arguments]
#
#        where the command line:
#
#        %command %arguments
#
#        would texify as normal. In other words, the "vimlatex" command
#        can simply be added before a given working command line.
